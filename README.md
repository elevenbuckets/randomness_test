# randomness_test

This is a repo for test of randomness.


## Entropy measurement

This could give one measurement of the randomness. We have normalized the entropy. So the value is always between 0 and 1. The larger the entropy is, the more random it is. To get more information about entropy you can refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)

## How to run
`node entropy.js`

The output is :

The input file length is : 15000
The unique number count is: 13414
The entropy is: 0.9843445072616206

## Chi-Squared test
Still in implenting...
